### Introduction
* The integer variables are represented in a signed and unsigned manner. The positive and negative values are differentiated by using the sign flag in signed numbers. The unsigned numbers do not use any flag for the sign, i.e., only positive numbers can be stored by the unsigned numbers.
* We represent the positive numbers without adding any sign before them and the negative number with - (minus) sign before them. But in the digital system, it is not possible to use negative sign before them because the data is in binary form in digital computers. For representing the sign in binary numbers, we require a special notation.
